# Boxnet
Virtual network I put together in Virtual Box for pentesting

I set up a VM network for pentesting that consists of 
  - Kali attack machine
  - Widows Server 2019 w/ Active Directory 
  - Windows 10 machine
  - Windows 11 machine
  - Windows XP PC (because I miss it so)
  
I call the network Boxnet. 

Not only is it great for attack scenarios but allows for hands-on work with Active Directory, which I'd only read about until now.
