# Boxnet
Virtual network I put together for pentesting

I set up a VM network for pentesting that consists of a Kali attack machine, a Widows Server 2019 w/ Active Directory, 
a Windows 10 machine, a Windows 11 Pmachine, and a Windows XP PC (because I miss it so). 
I call the network Boxnet. 
Not only is it great for attack scenarios but allows for hands-on work with Active Directory, which I'd only read about until now.
